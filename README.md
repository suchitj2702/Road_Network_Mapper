# Road_Segmentation
This is the first in the series of repositories in development of the Smart City
Planner research project I have been involved with for the past year.

In this project we aim to develop a dynamic web application which will ease the
process of city planning and development-tracking for the user with minimum
effort spent by the user in repetitive processes. With the widespread development
in the field of Artificial Intelligence, the aim is to at least being able to
reduce the repetitive processes such as spotting different features in an image
to only a computational challenge.
